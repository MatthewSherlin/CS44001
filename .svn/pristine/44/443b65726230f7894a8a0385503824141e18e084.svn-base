Paula the koala
She moved to Guatemala
Cuz she heard the trees there were a little taller
Turned out they were smaller
So she moved to lake eufuala
Then to Walla Walla Washington
So if you live in Walla Walla
And you see a koala
You can bet your bottom dollar
That koala's name is paula
Paula the koala
Who lives in walla walla
Walla walla Washington
